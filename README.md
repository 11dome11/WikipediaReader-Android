# WikipediaReader-Android
Simple WikipediaReader app made in Python for Android


It is a reader of all the entries in Wikipedia. The code is written entirely in Python using Spyder. The main library used is Kivy, a standard for building apps for Android and IOS. Taking advantage of the Google Colab interactive virtual environment, through a simple notebook I installed all the dependencies necessary to create the APK file (using the Buildozer library), which can be easily installed on any Android smartphone.
There is also the single APK file that can be installed on Android (it will ask for a couple of permissions because the source is not the PlayStore)
